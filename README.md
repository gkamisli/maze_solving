# Maze Solving Challenge
# A maze consists of a block of cells, defined as a n by m matrix. The cells within the maze are either X, O, or S. An S denotes the starting point, an O denotes an open cell which can be passed through, and an X denotes a wall, which cannot be passed through. The game is complete when the S reaches the edge of the maze. Consider the following example of a 6 * 5 maze:
# 
# XOXXXX 
# <br>XOXOOX 
# <br>XOXOXX 
# <br>XOOOSX 
# <br>XXXXXX
# 
# Write code in a language of your choice which will solve mazes similar to the one in the example above. You do not have to find the shortest path to the exit.
# Optional bonus tasks you could attempt or describe how you would approach:
# <br>● Find the shortest path
# <br>● Find all paths
# <br>● Optimise your algorithm to find a path (any path) as quickly as possible
# <br>● Expand to three dimensional mazes
